This project involves creating an HR report using Excel to analyze and visualize employee data. The project includes the following components:

<b>[MOCK_DATA]</b>: Raw data of employees, including various attributes such as name, age, department, and salary.
<br>
<b>[working sheet]</b>: Intermediate calculations and data manipulations to prepare the data for analysis.
<br>
<b>[pivot table]</b>: Summarized data using pivot tables for better insights.
<br>
<b>[dashboard]</b>: A final dashboard with visualizations to present the analysis in an easy-to-understand format.
